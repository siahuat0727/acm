 * Testcase Example:  '["ca","bb","ac"]'
 *
 * We are given an arrayÂ A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same
 * length.
 *
 * Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we
 * delete all the characters in those indices.
 *
 * For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion
 * indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef","vyz"].
 *
 * Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, the
 * final array has its elements in lexicographic order (A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2]
 * ... <= A[A.length - 1]).
 *
 * Return the minimum possible value of D.length.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: ["ca","bb","ac"]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * After deleting the first column, A = ["a", "b", "c"].
 * Now A is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2]).
 * We require at least 1 deletion since initially A was not in lexicographic
 * order, so the answer is 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: ["xc","yb","za"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * A is already in lexicographic order, so we don't need to delete anything.
 * Note that the rows of A are not necessarily in lexicographic order:
 * ie. it is NOT necessarily true that (A[0][0] <= A[0][1] <= ...)
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * We have to delete every column.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= A.length <= 100
 * 1 <= A[i].length <= 100
